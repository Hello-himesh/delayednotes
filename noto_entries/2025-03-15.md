# My First Journal Entry  

Today was a great day! I finally started working on my retro journal project.  
I spent most of the time debugging JavaScript (which I barely know).  

- Wrote my first `.md` file âœ…  
- Learned about `entries.json` âœ…  
- Struggled with JavaScript but made progress! âœ…  

Excited for tomorrow! ðŸš€
